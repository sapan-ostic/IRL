# The maximum required steps with a perfect policy is from corner to corner of
# the state space. Each dimension has the maximum speed so tha the goal can
# always be reached in 2 / max_speed steps. With max_speed = 0.05, it is 40.
# We provide double this steps so that a suboptimal agent can still reach the
# goal. The required steps for a perfect agent are dependent on the goal
# position and the initial state.
